Hi
Hello 
Good day :) 

I am kiwi, the fruit not the bird, I actually get very defensive when people confuse me with the bird. It doesn't even make sense! *Ahem* sorry, I'm a chill kiwi, I promise. Except when my kode doesn't work. I get a bit krazy when that happens. But yeah, I am the first of my kind. A koding kiwi :) 

Cool huh? 

Well, you should check out my other pages. My website is very nice if I do say so myself. There are some easter eggs around, so keep your eyes open ðŸ‘€...
